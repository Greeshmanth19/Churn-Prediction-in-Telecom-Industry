**Introduction**<br>
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry. This model aims to predict potential churners, allowing for proactive customer retention strategies.

**Dataset**<br>
The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, which consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription, will be used to develop predictive models.

**Methodology**<br>

**Data** Preprocessing: Data was cleaned, and relevant features were engineered.
**Exploratory** Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was conducted to gain insights into the data.
**Logistic Regression Model:** A logistic regression model was trained to predict churn probabilities.
**Model Evaluation:** The model achieved an accuracy of 98.34% on the test dataset.
